  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \

### Step 2 - Configure Jenkins to retrieve source codes from GitHub using Webhooks

* In this part, you will learn how to configure a simple Jenkins job/project (these two terms can be used interchangeably). This job will will be triggered by GitHub webhooks and will execute a 'build' task to retrieve codes from GitHub and store it locally on Jenkins server.

1. Enable webhooks in your GitHub repository settings
